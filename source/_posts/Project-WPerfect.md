Project WPerfect (http://wperfect.cf/) is a Windows Phone news website initialized by me as a administrator of windowsphone8 bar with the help from windowsphone9 bar.These are the posters I created to promote the project. The project was a failure and the team was disbanded. You can still visit the archives here: http://wp8bartemp.wordpress.com/

The following post are my Photoshop poster work from my early days using Photoshop when I started to learn to code. Really awful, isn't it?

Here are the posters I used in the later development. Looks a lot better.

Although Project WPerfect is failed, I learned a lot from the designing, programming and promoting. Although Windows Phone is a complete failure, I still love it. Hope Windows Phone can be reborn with the help of Windows 10.
