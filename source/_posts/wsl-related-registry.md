> Due to the lack of documentation, some of the information is possibly not complete or inaccurate. This is a updated version since WSLConf 2020.  

Information of WSL distributions store here: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss`. 

## Overview

![Overview of the key](https://cdn.patrickwu.space/works/wslconf/images/top_key.png)

- Subkeys are the definition of single WSL distributions. They are named using GUID.
- `DafaultDistribution`, RGE_SZ: This defines the default distribution used when using `bash.exe` and `wsl.exe`. The value passed is a GUID. By default, it's the first distribution installed.	
- `DefaultVersion`, REG_DWORD: (WSL2 Only) This defines the default WSL version that would be used for new WSL distributions.  Value for WSL1 is 0x1(1); for WSL2, 0x2(2).

### Store Distribution Key

Here are the details of the key values:
- `BasePath`, REG_SZ: This defines where the WSL distribution source location is.
- `DefaultEnvironment`, REG_MULTI_SZ: This defines the default environment value that passed to WSL Distribution when opening the WSL distribution.
- `DefaultUid`, REG_DWORD: This defines the default user for the distro. The value uses the `uid` in Linux, for example, `root` is always `0`. 
- `DistributionName`, REG_SZ: This defines the registered name of the WSL distribution. This will be used in `wsl.exe --list` and in `wsl.exe -d`.
- `Flags`, REG_DWORD: This defines the behavior of a distribution registered with the Windows Subsystem for Linux. The value passed is numeral combination of enumeration `WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS` , which is used by function `WslConfigureDistribution` in `wslapi.h`.  The default value is `WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_DEFAULT`, which is 0x7(7) in older version and 0xf(15) in newer version. Known available single options are the following:
	- `WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_NONE`: 0x0(0)
  - `WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_ENABLE_INTEROP`: 0x1(1)
  - `WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_APPEND_NT_PATH`: 0x2(2)
  - `WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_ENABLE_DRIVE_MOUNTING`: 0x4(4)
	
	There is also one undocumented flag with value 0x8(8) in the newer version, which defines which WSL version it is using. With the flag, the distro will be using WSL2.
- `KernelCommandLine`, REG_SZ: (2004 Only) This defines the command passed to WSL2 Kernel. 
- `PackageFamilyName`, REG_SZ: This defines the WSL distribution's UWP package Family name.
- `State`, REG_DWORD: This defines the state of WSL distribution. By default, it is in normal state 0x1(1). Here are also some other states:
	- Normal: 0x1(1)
	- Installing: 0x3(3)
	- Uninstalling: 0x4(4)
- `Version`, REG_DWORD: Do not confuse this with `DefaultVersion`! They define two entire different settings. This defines whether you are using `wslfs` or `lxfs` for the filesystem. Value for `lxfs` is 0x1(1); for `wslfs`, 0x2(2).

### Imported Distribution Key

As you can see, by default imported distribution do not have `DefaultEnvironment`â€Œ, `KernelCommandLine` and `PackageFamilyName`. Also by default, `DefaultUid` will be `0` which is root.
