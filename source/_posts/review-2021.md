Wait, it's already 2022 and I forget to have a year review?

Well damn it, time for my (late) annual review, starting from my last (last) year's goal:

## 2021, Did I do it?

In [Last (Last) Year's Annual Review](https://patrickwu.space/2019/12/25/review-2019/), I made the following goal for the year:

- Write a novel planned and *Ultimate Guide to WSL*
- Get a girlfriend
- Get Fit

### Write a novel planned and *Ultimate Guide to WSL*

Not really. I do pick up and did a bit of them. I think I should start to do them this year for real -- with some more extra time recently.

### Get a girlfriend

Well, of course not. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

### Get Fit

The only one I did from 2020's goal. I increased my muscle and reduced body fat by going to gym frequently in 2021. I had to force myself due to the requirement for taking the COVID-19 vaccine. 

## 2021, what did I do?

Oh boy, I did a lot of things in 2021. 

Firstly, I completed my Master degree of Computer Science and graduated from CUHK:

I also sucessfully getting my visceral fat reduced to the safe level and got my COVID-19 vaccine shots;

And besides, I made multiple talks in 2021, including the following:

- [WSL Panel on WSL Utilities, Kernel, Ubuntu news and Windows Integration](https://youtu.be/6KlAYAyihe8) Hosted by [AzureTar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3FS96NUdoR3DwkaDwiLdRw);
- [WSL Series 2 - Advanced WSL2](https://youtu.be/NcM5zBmCrZA) during [WSL Days](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5uLNcv9SibDJNEJBu8N8VhV-QkE6ZFQQ); and
- [Developing on Ubuntu with WSL Interoperability: Tips and Tricks](https://youtu.be/ieqCropntu4) on Ubucon Asia 2021.

## 2021, what did I make?

I made not much things this year due to focusing on the school and exercise. I do code a lot for multiple projects and most importantly, I started to contribute more on external projects like [this](https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/pull/213) and [this](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL). Besides, I didn't photograph much in 2021. Did start to make some pixel arts like [this one](https://www.deviantart.com/callmepk/art/Early-Spring-879665238):

## 2022, what's next?

### Get a overseas job

Yep, although the pandemic is still going, I am now more focus on getting myself out of Hong Kong due to the worsen political environment. The concern of further censoring the internet now forces me to look for a overseas job. Of course, I am still working on it.

### Get a girlfriend

**THE** annual list member is back and stronger than ever! Well this one won't be crossed out any time soon again ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

### Write a novel planned (Optional) and *Ultimate Guide to WSL*

*Ultimate Guide to WSL* will be one of my focus this year. With less diatraction, I will be able to do it more efficiently this year. However, for the novel, although I already have the plot set, I will postpone it if time don't allow it to happen.

### Learn Japanese

This time is not just casual Japanese on Duolingo; I decide to learn to at least get N3 passed.
