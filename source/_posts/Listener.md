![I hate myself.](https://cdn.patrickwu.space/posts/essay/listener.png)

<!--more-->

I just hate myself sometimes. 

I felt guity all the time. I felt I should not speak. I feel I am disturbing everyone. I hate to be a laughter. I am afraid to be an attention. 

But I want attention. I feel self-contradicted. I should not be doing this. 

But I hope I am popular. But no one really cares me. I realized I am just nothing. 

Sometimes, I see my project or my photograph gets attention, but I am also really concerned; I know critic is necessary, but I fear it. 

I hate myself.

I want to change, and I hate myself.

And now I know. Thank you. And I will be a listener. I should not say anything.

THANK YOU. AND I STILL HATE MYSELF.
