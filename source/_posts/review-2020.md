Well, you know what time it is. It's my annual review time. And from now on, the review will be in English. 

With the pandemic going on and the continuing political suppression in Hong Kong, it is getting very emotional for me this year.

Let's review my 2020, starting from my last year's goal:

## 2020, Did I do it?

In [Last Year's Annual Review](https://patrickwu.space/2019/12/25/review-2019/), I made the following goal for the year:

- 開始做音樂 (Start Making Music)
- 寫《和平路書報攤》和《WSL指北》(Write a novel planned and *Ultimate Guide to WSL*)
- 認真的去找個女朋友(Get a girlfriend, seriously)
- 繼續鍛鍊(Keep Exercising)
- 找到工作/考研成功 (Find a job or pursue a master degree successfully)

### Starting Making Music

I did start to compose some small pieces of music... Although nothing is published, progress is progress.

### Write a novel planned and *Ultimate Guide to WSL*

Almost forget I have these goals... Should pick them up next year

### Get a girlfriend, seriously

Initially want to make a pandemic excuse, but well, it's still my own fault for not socializing ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

This is going to stay on the annual goal list forever...

### Keep Exercising

I did! With getting Nintendo Switch, I no longer just jogging... I also do different exercises in RingFit Adventure and Rope Skipping in Rope Jump Challenge, which made me regret why I didn't get it early this year.

### Find a job or pursue a master degree successfully

I actually never thought this would not only be achieved but also the "or" should be changed to "and." Not only I got a dream job at Canonical, but even I earned a master's degree offer from CUHK with a scholarship.

## 2020, what did I do?

This year, despite the awful toxic environment around the world, I did more things I thought I would do this year, mostly due to lock-downs.

I gave [a talk]() in WSLConf 2020, and with the help of it, I was able to get a Software Developer job at Canonical focusing on developing Ubuntu for WSL and Hyper-V. I thought this is the end of the surprise, but no, I got a master's offer with a scholarship! I never thought I would achieve that much this year, but here we are.

This year, I started to study Esperanto(Estas mia plej flua lingvo, unu afiŝo elvenos baldaŭ), Japanese(流暢に話せません), and French(Je est débutant).

This year, I got Netflix and started to watch there, which allowed me to watch more movies and shows than before.

This year, I did not do much of the reading, mostly due to the work and study. I do pick up the Fazbear's Frights series, but that is mostly all. Next year, I think I can get more chances to read after my master study complete.


## 2020, what did I make?

I made a lot of things this year. Within this year, I made Ubuntu WSL Onboarding Experience that consists of the main OOBE Experience (`ubuntu-wsl-oobe`), the `ubuntuwsl` utility (`ubuntu-wsl-integration`), and CI/CD system for Ubuntu (`ubuntu-cooker`). Also, during this period, I successfully completed another project, `PsUWI`.

My old project, `wslu` now reaches version 3.2.1, and 4.0.0 is still being worked on. 

Due to the pandemic, I cannot do much of the photography this year, but I did take some of the photos that receive some good response like [this one](https://unsplash.com/photos/v8dj-2mURXo) with over 100k views.

## 2021, what's next?


### Write a novel planned and *Ultimate Guide to WSL*

I have a terrible habit of not able to concentrate on writing... This year, I will start trying my best to spare time to write them.

### Get a girlfriend

Well, **THE** annual list member that won't be crossed out any time soon ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

### Get Fit

As I continue to exercise, I should start moving to the next stage: Not just exercise, I should begin to lose weight and get fit.
